```

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the development server:
   ```
   npm start
   ```

3. Build for production:
   ```
   npm run build
   ```

## Development Mode

The application includes a development bypass for authentication to facilitate testing. This is controlled by the `DEV_MODE` flag in `src/contexts/AuthContext.jsx`.

When `DEV_MODE` is enabled:
- Authentication is bypassed
- A mock user (dev@example.com) is automatically logged in
- The dashboard is directly accessible without real authentication

To disable DEV_MODE for production, set the flag to `false`:

```javascript
// In src/contexts/AuthContext.jsx
const DEV_MODE = false;
```

## Component Usage

### Recipe Substitution Calculator

```jsx
import RecipeSubstitutionCalculator from './components/RecipeSubstitutionCalculator';

function MyComponent() {
  return (
    <div>
      <RecipeSubstitutionCalculator />
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Cooking Temperature Guide

```jsx
import CookingTemperatureGuide from './components/CookingTemperatureGuide';

function MyComponent() {
  return (
    <div>
      <CookingTemperatureGuide />
    </div>
  );
}
```

### AI Components

```jsx
import { AIRecipeAnalysis, AICookingAssistant } from './components/AIComponents';

function MyComponent() {
  const recipe = {
    id: 1,
    name: 'Chocolate Chip Cookies',
    // ... other recipe properties
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <AIRecipeAnalysis recipe={recipe} />
      <AICookingAssistant />
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Interactive Recipe Cards

```jsx
import { RecipeGrid } from './components/RecipeInteractiveComponents';

function MyComponent() {
  const recipes = [
    // Your recipe data
  ];

  const handleFilterChange = (filterType, value) => {
    // Handle filter changes
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <RecipeGrid 
        recipes={recipes} 
        onFilterChange={handleFilterChange} 
      />
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Customization

### Styling

The UI uses Tailwind CSS for styling. You can customize the theme by modifying the `tailwind.config.js` file.

### Icons

Custom cooking-themed SVG icons are defined in `src/components/CookingIcons.jsx`. You can use these icons throughout your application:

```jsx
import { EggIcon, WhiskIcon, CupcakeIcon } from './components/CookingIcons';

function MyComponent() {
  return (
    <div>
      <EggIcon />
      <WhiskIcon />
      <CupcakeIcon />
    </div>
  );
}
```

## AI Functionality

The enhanced UI includes two AI-powered features:

1. **AI Recipe Analysis**: Provides detailed analysis of recipes with tabs for overview, nutrition insights, cooking tips, substitutions, and pairings.

2. **AI Cooking Assistant**: Chat interface where users can ask cooking-related questions and receive AI-generated responses.

In the current implementation, these features use mock data to simulate AI functionality. In a production environment, you would replace the mock data generation with actual API calls to your AI service.

## Responsive Design

The UI is designed to work on all device sizes. The layout adjusts automatically for mobile, tablet, and desktop views.

## Browser Compatibility

The enhanced UI is compatible with modern browsers including:
- Chrome (latest)
- Firefox (latest)
- Safari (latest)
- Edge (latest)
