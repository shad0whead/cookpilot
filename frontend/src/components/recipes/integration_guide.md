# CookPilot Enhanced Features Integration Guide

This guide will help you integrate the new enhanced features into your CookPilot application, including the Recipe Substitution Calculator and Cooking Temperature Guide.

## What's Included

1. **Recipe Substitution Calculator**: A dynamic tool that allows users to substitute ingredients while maintaining recipe balance
2. **Cooking Temperature Guide**: A comprehensive reference for safe cooking temperatures based on the data you provided
3. **Integrated Interface**: A combined component that shows how these features work together in your existing UI

## Files Overview

- `RecipeSubstitutionCalculator.jsx`: The substitution calculator component
- `CookingTemperatureGuide.jsx`: The temperature guide component
- `CookingToolsIntegrated.jsx`: A demonstration of how both components integrate with your existing UI

## Integration Instructions

### Option 1: Add Individual Components

1. **Add the Recipe Substitution Calculator**:
   - Copy `RecipeSubstitutionCalculator.jsx` to your project's components directory
   - Import and add the component to your desired page:
   ```jsx
   import RecipeSubstitutionCalculator from './path/to/RecipeSubstitutionCalculator';
   
   // Then in your component:
   <RecipeSubstitutionCalculator />
   ```

2. **Add the Cooking Temperature Guide**:
   - Copy `CookingTemperatureGuide.jsx` to your project's components directory
   - Import and add the component to your desired page:
   ```jsx
   import CookingTemperatureGuide from './path/to/CookingTemperatureGuide';
   
   // Then in your component:
   <CookingTemperatureGuide />
   ```

### Option 2: Use the Integrated Component

For a complete implementation that matches your existing UI:

1. Copy all three files to your project's components directory
2. Import the integrated component:
   ```jsx
   import CookingToolsIntegrated from './path/to/CookingToolsIntegrated';
   
   // Then use it as your main application component:
   <CookingToolsIntegrated />
   ```

## Styling

These components are designed to match your preferred dark theme with:
- Dark background (#1A202C)
- Cream/beige cards and information panels (#F5F5DC)
- Amber/orange food illustrations and accents (#D4A76A)
- Olive green plant elements (#A3B18A)

The components use Tailwind CSS classes. If you're not using Tailwind, you'll need to add the equivalent CSS styles.

## Customization

### Recipe Substitution Calculator

You can customize the substitution database by modifying the `substitutionDatabase` object in `RecipeSubstitutionCalculator.jsx`. Each ingredient can have multiple substitution options with properties:

- `name`: Name of the substitution
- `ratio`: Conversion ratio
- `impact`: Description of how it affects the recipe
- `balanceEffect`: Numerical value representing impact on recipe balance

### Cooking Temperature Guide

You can update the temperature data by modifying the `temperatureData` object in `CookingTemperatureGuide.jsx`. The data is organized by categories, and each item has:

- `food`: Name of the food item
- `temp`: Safe cooking temperature
- `notes`: Additional cooking notes

## Next Steps

1. Consider expanding the substitution database with more ingredients and alternatives
2. Add functionality to save substitution choices to the recipe
3. Integrate the temperature guide with your recipe creation workflow
